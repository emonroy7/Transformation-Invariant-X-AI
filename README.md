# Transformation-Invariant Explainable AI (XAI)

---

## 1. Summary
**Explainable AI (XAI)** has emerged as a critical field for making **deep learning models** more 
transparent and trustworthy, particularly as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to power 
state-of-the-art **Computer Vision** systems despite acting as **"black boxes"**. Among XAI techniques, 
**Grad-CAM** is one of the most widely adopted. It generates visual heatmaps that highlight the 
image regions most responsible for a model's prediction, helping researchers and users understand 
and trust model decisions.


**Grad-CAM** explains a CNN's prediction by producing a heatmap over the image regions
that most influence a target class, using the gradients flowing into the final
convolutional layer. But Grad-CAM is **not transformation-invariant**: rotating,
zooming, or shifting the same image can noticeably change the heatmap even when the
prediction stays the same. This project quantifies that instability across three CNN
backbones and proposes a **realignment-and-averaging framework** that yields rotation,
zoom, and shift-invariant heatmaps **without retraining the model**.

## 2. Research Objectives

- Quantify Grad-CAM's sensitivity to rotation, zoom, and horizontal/vertical shifts.
- Build a pipeline that inverse-realigns and averages heatmaps across transformed views.
- Propose rotation-, zoom-, and shift-invariant Grad-CAM variants.
- Validate across ResNet152, DenseNet201, and Xception.
- Evaluate both qualitatively and quantitatively (L2, AUC-ROC).

## 3. Research Questions

- **RQ1** — How sensitive is Grad-CAM to common spatial transforms?
- **RQ2** — Can that sensitivity be reliably quantified (L2, AUC-ROC)?
- **RQ3** — Can inverse realignment + averaging improve invariance?
- **RQ4** — Do architectures differ in robustness?
- **RQ5** — Does the approach generalize to natural *and* medical images?

## 4. Methodology

The proposed framework transforms the input, computes Grad-CAM on each transformed
view, inverse-aligns every heatmap back to the original coordinate frame, and averages
the aligned maps into a single, transformation-invariant explanation. It is applied
independently to four transformation families.

### 4.1 Rotation-Invariant Grad-CAM

For each angle $\theta_i \in [-180^\circ, +180^\circ]$ at $30^\circ$ increments,
rotate the original image, compute Grad-CAM, rotate the resulting map back by
$-\theta_i$, and average:

$$I^{i}_{rot} = \text{Rotate}(I_{orig}, \theta_i)$$

$$H^{i}_{rot} = \text{GradCAM}(I^{i}_{rot})$$

$$H^{i}_{realign} = \text{Rotate}(H^{i}_{rot}, -\theta_i)$$

$$H_{rot\text{-}inv} = \frac{1}{N_\theta}\sum_{i=1}^{N_\theta} H^{i}_{realign}, \quad \text{where } N_\theta = \text{total number of rotation angles}$$


### 4.2 Zoom-Invariant Grad-CAM

For each zoom factor $Z_i \in \{0.67, 0.71, 0.77, 0.83, 0.91, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5\}$,
resize the image (bilinear interpolation with padding/cropping to preserve the field
of view), compute Grad-CAM, rescale the map to the original resolution, and average:

$$I^{i}_{zoom} = \text{Zoom}(I_{orig}, Z_i)$$

$$H^{i}_{zoom} = \text{GradCAM}(I^{i}_{zoom})$$

$$H^{i}_{rescale} = \text{Zoom}(H^{i}_{zoom}, \text{original size})$$

$$H_{zoom\text{-}inv} = \frac{1}{N_z}\sum_{i=1}^{N_z} H^{i}_{rescale}, \quad \text{where } N_z = \text{total number of zoom factors}$$




### 4.3 Shift-X-Invariant Grad-CAM

For each integer pixel offset $P_x \in [-180, +180]$, apply a cyclic (roll) horizontal
shift, compute Grad-CAM, shift the map back by $-P_x$, and average:

$$I^{x}_{shift} = \text{Shift}_x(I_{orig}, P_x)$$

$$H^{x}_{shift} = \text{GradCAM}(I^{x}_{shift})$$

$$H^{x}_{realign} = \text{Shift}_x(H^{x}_{shift}, -P_x)$$

$$H_{shiftX\text{-}inv} = \frac{1}{N_x}\sum_{x} H^{x}_{realign}, \quad \text{where } N_x = \text{total number of shifted pixels on the x-axis}$$


### 4.4 Shift-Y-Invariant Grad-CAM

Analogously, for each integer pixel offset $P_y \in [-180, +180]$, apply a cyclic
vertical shift, compute Grad-CAM, shift the map back by $-P_y$, and average:

$$I^{y}_{shift} = \text{Shift}_y(I_{orig}, P_y)$$

$$H^{y}_{shift} = \text{GradCAM}(I^{y}_{shift})$$

$$H^{y}_{realign} = \text{Shift}_y(H^{y}_{shift}, -P_y)$$

$$H_{shiftY\text{-}inv} = \frac{1}{N_y}\sum_{y} H^{y}_{realign}, \quad \text{where } N_y = \text{total number of shifted pixels on the y-axis}$$

## 5. Experimental Setup

### Model Architectures

All backbones are ImageNet-pretrained and used without fine-tuning; Grad-CAM is
computed at the last convolutional layer before global pooling.

| Model | Parameters (M) | Grad-CAM Layer | Input Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| ResNet152 | 60.2 | `conv5_block3_out` | 224 × 224 |
| DenseNet201 | 20.2 | `conv5_block32_concat` | 224 × 224 |
| Xception | 22.9 | `block14_sepconv2_act` | 299 × 299 |

*Table 1: Model architectures and Grad-CAM configuration.*

### Datasets

| Dataset | Classes | Training | Validation | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MS COCO (2017) | 80 | 118,287 | 5,000 | 20,000 |
| CAMELYON16 (patches) | 2 | 64,000 | 8,000 | 8,000 |

*Table 2: Dataset statistics.*

### Evaluation Metrics

- **L2 difference** — pixel-wise Euclidean distance between two heatmaps; **lower = more stable**.

$$L2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i}\left(H^{orig}_i - H^{trans}_i\right)^2}$$

- **AUC-ROC** — how well the normalized heatmap separates the object/tumor region from
  background against a binary mask; **higher = better localization** (reported as
  $\mu \pm \sigma$ across images).

## 6. Experiments

### Experiment 1 — Single-Image Transformation Consistency

Apply each of the four transformations to a single image (per backbone), inverse-align
every heatmap, and average. Sensitivity is measured by the L2 difference across
transformation magnitudes.

### Experiment 2 — Class-Specific Evaluation

Repeat the analysis for two object categories ("Dog", "Cat") across all three
backbones to test whether robustness is class-dependent.

### Experiment 3 — Dataset-Level Evaluation (MS COCO)

Scale up to MS COCO (80 classes with pixel-level masks). Binary ground-truth masks are
built from COCO polygon/RLE annotations, and each backbone's Baseline is compared
against the four invariant variants by L2 and AUC-ROC.


### Experiment 4 — Histopathology Image Evaluation (CAMELYON16)

Evaluate **zoom-invariant** Grad-CAM on histopathology patches (96 × 96 px; a patch is
labeled tumor if its central 32 × 32 region contains tumor tissue). For each patch,
Grad-CAM maps across zoom levels are inverse-aligned and averaged; stability (L2) and
faithfulness (AUC-ROC vs. tumor masks) are reported per backbone.

## 7. Results & Key Findings

- Grad-CAM is **measurably sensitive** to rotation, zoom, and shifts.
- **Inverse-alignment + averaging materially improves stability**. Lower L2 and higher AUC than Baseline.
- Gains hold **across all three backbones and both domains** (natural and medical images).
- Achieved with **no model retraining**.

## 8. Conclusion

This work quantified Grad-CAM's transformation sensitivity, proposed an invariant
heatmap pipeline based on inverse alignment and averaging, and demonstrated improved
stability (lower L2, better AUC) across architectures and datasets, a practical step
toward trustworthy, consistent visual explanations.

## 9. Future Directions

- Extend the invariance pipeline to other XAI methods.
- Explore joint training with invariance regularization.
- Generalize to detection, segmentation, and multimodal tasks.
- Create standardized robustness benchmarks and user studies.
